# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a simple implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game where you play against the computer.

## Features

- Play as `'X'` and compete against the computer.
- The computer plays as `'O'` and uses basic strategy to block and win.
- The game supports replays and announces the result after each game (win, lose, or tie).

## How to Play

1. Run the script to start the game.
2. You will be prompted to select a position on the board between 1 and 9:
    - The positions correspond to the grid layout as shown below:

    ```
     1 | 2 | 3
    ------------
     4 | 5 | 6
    ------------
     7 | 8 | 9
    ```

3. After you make your move, the computer will place its `'O'` on the board.
4. The game will continue until someone wins or the board is full (resulting in a tie).

## Board Layout

The board is a 3x3 grid represented by numbers 1 through 9. When prompted to make a move, enter the number corresponding to the position where you want to place your `'X'`.

## Running the Game

1. Make sure Python is installed on your system.
2. Download the script `1.1 Tictac.py`.
3. Run the script in your terminal or command prompt:

    ```bash
    python 1.1 Tictac.py
    ```

4. Follow the instructions in the terminal to play the game.
